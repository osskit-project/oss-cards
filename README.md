== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many cards I can add? =
As many as you wish. In horizontal mode maximum cards in row is four, but  you can have more. If you amount not equal 4 for row, rest of cards also have same width and will be centered.

= What icons do you use =
We use FontAwesome version 5. We tried to use Google Material Icons as it has 4 more parameters for settings, but unfortunately it's done as direct code, not as class - ie it can show code, for a moments while css is loading, it's not good, especially if icon is big as we use.
= What is export option =
Using export option you can copy JSON code of cards and pass it to another or even to another site. Import is looks like export - just click export tab on new cards, and paste code replacing existing default one. Don't forget to save and reload page then
= I have problem with my cards, how can you help me =
Function Export also was done for debugging, just copy code from Export tab and send.
